# Notebooks for Global Hydrology (GEGR10146)

By Simon Moulds 

## Overview 
This repository contains jupyter notebooks for teaching hydrological analysis. 

The notebooks can be run on the University of Edinburgh [Noteable](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/noteable) service, a third-party service such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), or locally using your favourite text editor (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py)). 

## Usage instructions

This section details how to use the notebooks in Noteable. If you are enrolled in the Global Hydrology course then you can find the Noteable link in the course materials section of the Learn page. 

If you are not on the course then you can use the [direct ease login](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/noteable/accessing-noteable). 

In either case, start a notebook server with the "GeoScience Notebook" server. 

## Data 
I do not have permission to distribute the datasets we will use in class, so you will need to download them yourself. Instructions for obtaining the necessary data will be included at the top of each notebook.
